dotSetting
==========

After few years of usage in commandline, I got a lot of setting like `.bashrc`, `.vimrc`, `.tmux.conf`...  
When the time to migrate at a new machine, it might be somehow troubling. So I use [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick)

## Requirement

Same as [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick)

## HOW TO USE THIS?

This will be added later, including `curl ... | sh` and `.../install.sh` method
